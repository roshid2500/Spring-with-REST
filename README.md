# Spring-with-REST
Small Spring boot project that makes use of REST API

In order to run it, go to src/main/java/example/DemoApplication. 
Run the DemoApplication class and open localhost:8080/students on your browser. 

This project is purely to understand how REST is used in a very simple setting. It uses a h2 database, which it creates 
after every run with one record in the students table. 

In order to better use REST methods, go to localhost:8080/browser/index.html 
Here you can more easily use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
